# Allow each user to have their own schedule viewable by them 
# and accessible for comparison to another user's schedule

# create user class with intialized hash empty 
# (later to be filled with each hour that is free)
# steps: create user class with initialize method that takes name as parameter

# output: returns empty schedule
