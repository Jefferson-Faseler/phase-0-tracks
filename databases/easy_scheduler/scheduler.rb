# An application that compares windows of time and openings so that 
# people can find ways to meet together. 
# If I have Tuesday morning, wed afternoon and wed night open and that is it 
# And Steve has Monday morning, Wed night, and Friday morning open 
# We can cross reference the times with the program 
# and it will tell us when we have openings

# to get more ambitous if you have more than one time 
# slot that overlap it will tell you how long of a time slot each is.
