# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful? 
  * Version control is the practice of ensuring any new development, or version, of a project is segregated into its individual save. This is useful to keep any changes seperate from the working model so that the new version is not implemented or added prematurely. It is also useful to keep any mistakes from making their way into the presentable model/code. 
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
  * A branch is a new direction, or change, from the "master" branch of code. A branch is often used for version control, but can be used to make a new program out of an existing one. 
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
  * A commit is a save of any changes made to code. A good commit message describes what changes were made, this is useful for reference in version control or debugging. 
* What is a merge conflict?
  * A merge conflict is the result of conflicting commits between either the merging branch or the branch being merged into. Meaning, each branch has had commits regarding the same file(s) and a decision is necessary between the changes. An example would be that in one branch a change was made to the [header](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_header.asp) to say "Hello" and in the other branch the header was changed to "Hey". The conflict would be that both branches have made changes since the newer branch "branched" off.
