<h1>Looking into a day in the life of a NY house cat</h1>
<p>When the windows turn on and my humans have not yet stirred I must act. On a good day my humans will wake to make themselves a crushed hot bean drink, it smells of dirt and occasionally another cat's poop. But on the days when the windows turn on and they still lay there I must rub their faces or they will die.
