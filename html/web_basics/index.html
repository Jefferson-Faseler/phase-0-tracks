  <h1>Looking into a day in the life of a NY house cat
  </h1>  
    <p>When the windows turn on and my humans have not yet stirred I <strong>must act</strong>. On a good day my humans will wake to make themselves a crushed hot bean drink, it smells of dirt and occasionally another cat's poop. But on the days when the windows turn on and they still lay there I must rub their faces <em>or they will die</em>.

    <p>After the humans have consumed their hot bean drink I might get scratches from my human.
