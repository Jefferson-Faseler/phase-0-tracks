  <h1>Looking into a day in the life of a NY house cat
  </h1>  
    <p>When the windows turn on and my humans have not yet stirred I <strong>must act</strong>. On a good day my humans will wake to make themselves a crushed hot bean drink, it smells of dirt and occasionally another cat's poop. But on the days when the windows turn on and they still lay there I must rub their faces <em>or they will die</em>.

    <p>After the humans have consumed their hot bean drink I might get scratches from my human.

      <em>On good days it continues. Ooooh, aaaaaaahh...</em>

  <h2>But then the abomination...
  </h2>
      <img src="you_know_what_you_did.JPG">
    <p>The sloppy collision of dog and machine! It traps you into its massive blue scoop and tries to feed.
    
    The dangerous aspects of the beast are.
      <ol>
        <li>Gaping jaws</li>
        <li>Monstrous scoop</li>
        <li>Its thirst for blood</li>
      </ol>

    If am careful I can hide in the human's sleeping room. There I wait for their return...
    </p>

    <p>The small human has grown from larva to miniature. She still smells of milk, but tends to be very... grabby... If I wait until she slumbers I can lick the dried milk from her cheeks.

  <h3>The remainder of my day will usually contain all if not some of the following.</h3>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>-Hiding under the bed</li>
        <li>-Chasing the mysterious <a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/cat-laser-pointer-ORvqEUSPxdPqw">red light</a>
        </li>
        <li>-Swatting pen caps</li> 
        <li>-Sleep</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

  <h4>Until tomorrow...</h4>
