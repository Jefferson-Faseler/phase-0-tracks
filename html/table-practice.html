      <td>Rock</td>
      <td>Emphasis on electric guitar, with staples such as bass, drums, and vocals. Rock music is influenced by many genres and is often a starting point for musical creativity. It relies heavily on passionate emotions. It also sounds great.</td>

    <tr>
      <td>Jazz</td>
      <td>Too difficult to define, but it has a swinging feeling. Heavy use of polyrhythms and improvisation make this music infinite in possiblities, and always changing. Jazz can contain multiple soloes and relies heavily on a "teamwork" aspect that requires each musician to be in the same mindset and know where the song is traveling during improvisational movements. Good jazz musicians are in the same spirit with one another while playing. Sometimes jazz music doesn't resolve, forcing the listener to reflect and wait for more.</td>
