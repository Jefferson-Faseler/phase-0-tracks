    <h2>The Golden Ratio</h2>
      <p>Photography is a artistic skill. A photographer must know what to take pictures of, and how to use the medium to convey what message (or I guess with modern art a non-message). But to get the incredibly artistic pictures a photographer snaps a photographer must also have skill. There is a skill within the shutter flash, not just to know how to use those thousand dollar cameras, but in knowing where to stand and how to wait. Photography is a skill similar to hunting. For some dedicated photographers it is a skill of math too.

      <p>Similar to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number">Fibonacci Sequence</a>, The Golden Ratio is a way to capture pleasing and striking images. The images are pleasing to eye because the use of proportions and symmetry. Some believe this method has been used for centuries, even by the Egyptians in pyramid building.
