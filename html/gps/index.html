<!-- The purpose of HTML tags are for semantic reasons for anything/anyone looking at the code behind-the-scenes. I see the most useful being nav with header and footer coming in a close second. These are useful for CSS styling and screen readers. Section, article, and div are all so similar but with the same function, but nontheless useful for breaking the code into "chunks" and for screenreaders to know how to assign importance to the body of the page.

The order the page will load is HTML first and then line by line descending down the page. 

I learned that sublime will allow me to widen the scope of snippets, that will be super handy. Yes, I loved making aliases so snippets will be coming soon for me. 

I really did not have any difficulties with these concepts. I had learned most of what we went over to this point. >
