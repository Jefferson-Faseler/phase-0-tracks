2. Some common codes in HTTP requests are:
* 100 for informational requests (rare)
* 200 for success (very common)
* 300 for redirection that usually without user interaction
* 400 for client errors
* 500 for server errors

3. GET v POST
* GET is retrieving information
** when you Google search something or look up a website
* POST is to post or update information, sending information out
** when you post a facebook status or the creation of something new

4. Cookies
* A cookie is a small amount of data stored in a computer about a user's visit to the site, or a related site, that can be accessed by a site. This information is "carried" with the user, allowing a site to tailor how it behaves for the user. This allows the user's computer to keep information, rather than the server for the website. Cookies are saved and accessed as key/value pairs by the website. This happens during the HTTP headers in the request and response of a site.
