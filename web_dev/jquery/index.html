      <p>I began to see the horror</p>
      <img id='clothes' src='img/clothes.jpg'>
      <p>I wasn't expecting her to do this, in fact I had started a mental list of everything I was going to get her.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A cool Broad City mug</li>
          <li>Wireless charger for her phone</li>
          <li>Recording of her favoirte muscial production</li>
          <li>And a picture frame of us with out daughter</li>
        </ul>
      <p>And then I really started to panic</p>
      <img id='bike' src='img/bike.jpg'>
      <p>Her purchase list was <em>growing</em></p>
      <p>As fast as my confusion</p>
      <img id='more-clothes' src="img/moreclothes.jpg">
      <p>And that's what happened that one time in that story I just made up.</p>
