jQuery plan
* read intro to jQuery posts
* find one or two concepts and dive in to those
* repeat step two until I've read the entire post from step one
  ** the above steps will give me enough of a crashcourse to understand not just what jQuery is or what it can do. But how. 

* when finished look at codeschool jquery pdf and watch video on concepts that may need solidifying 
* no breaks, my daughter is only at daycare until 11:30
  ** unless I run out of coffee or get hungry

add resources to bookmark collection

My result was a poor attempt so I tried again this evening. Here is what happened:
* I Read 200 pages of Jon Duckett's Javascript & jQuery book
* I retained a lot of useful information
* My comfort with javascript grew
* I spent three hours on this (sorry)
* I did not get much jquery done in 45 minutes
